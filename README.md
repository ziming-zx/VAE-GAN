# VAE-GAN
Time series probabilistic forecasting often struggles to fully capture the underlying distribution. This work leverages VAE-GAN to address this limitation.

We present a probabilistic model trained with VAE-GAN, designed to generate confidence intervals for predicted time series.

The code will be made available once the paper is accepted.
